description:

Each feature is a numeric value from [0,1]. 

The features selected come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial 
raw signals tAccXYZ and tGyroXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAccXYZ and tGravityAccXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerkXYZ and tBodyGyroJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, 
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAccXYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAccXYZ

tBodyGyroMag

fBodyAccXYZ
fBodyAccJerkXYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean: Mean value
Std: Standard deviation
MeanFreq: Mean frequency
(note: project description said to include all mean and std measurements.  I have made judgement call 
that "Mean frequency" should be considered a kind of mean measurement.  Your Mileage May Vary)


II: agg_tidydata data set:

Data set derived from the tidydata data set described above.  
Data set comprises the average of measurements on 30 individuals (subjects) performing 
six different types of activity.  There is one record for each combination of
Subject and Activity.

description:

Each feature is a numeric value from [0,1]. 

The data here are averages (by each Subject and Activity) of the features described below. 

In this data set, in addition to description of naming conventions given below, 
each feature name is prefixed by  "avgBySubjectActivity" to make the aggregated nature of this 
data explicit. 

Note that by virtue of the aggregation, this set has one record for each Subject plus Activity.

The features selected (which have subsequently been averaged by Subject and Activity)
 come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial 
raw signals tAccXYZ and tGyroXYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) 
were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter 
and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(tBodyAccXYZ and tGravityAccXYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerkXYZ and tBodyGyroJerkXYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional 
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, 
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAccXYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

(note: project description said to include all mean and std measurements.  I have made judgement call 
that "Mean frequency" should be considered a kind of mean measurement.  Your Mileage May Vary)
